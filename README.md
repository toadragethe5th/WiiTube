# WiiTube

## An Unofficial Version of YouTube on the Wii.

This project is inspired by how  WiiMC (Wii Media Center) made by the user [dborth](https://github.com/dborth) could play youtube videos, and how we could make something similiar with a more intuitive UI.

Once there is an full build, there will be a video showcasing it.
