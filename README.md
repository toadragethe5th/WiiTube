# WiiTube

## a unofficial version of YouTube on the Wii

This project is inspired by how  WiiMC (Wii Media Center) made by the user [dborth](https://github.com/dborth) could play youtube videos.
and how we could make something simiular with a more intuitive UI

once there is an full build there will be a video showcasing it, it might be low quality beacuse it most likely be ran on a real wii with a crappy recordor, we will try to get it to work with dolphin for a higher qauility image, though running on original hardware is always first priority.
