# WiiTube

a unnafoil version of youtube on the wii
ispired by how  wiimc (wii medai center) made by dborth could play youtube videos.
and how we could make somthing simmalar with a more intutive UI

once there is an full build there will be a video showcasing it, it might be low quility beacuse it most lickley be ra on real wii with a crappy recoerdor, we will try to get it to work with dolphin for a higher qauility image, though running on origional hardware is always first prooirityy
